keepTrace
=========

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/internetimagery/keepTrace.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/internetimagery/keepTrace)

This project provides the ability to pickle traceback objects.
Specifically including enough details about the exception to be able to restore
and debug the traceback at a later date.

``` python
try:
    some_bad_code()
except Exception:
    import sys, pickle, keepTrace
    keepTrace.init() # Can be initialized at any point before pickle
    with open(some_path, "wb") as f:
        pickle.dump(sys.exc_info(), f)
```

> ...sometime later...

``` python
import pickle, pdb, traceback
with open(some_path, "rb") as f:
  exc = pickle.load(f)
traceback.print_exception(*exc)
pdb.post_mortem(exc[2])
```

The details of where and how you choose to save the pickle remain with the reader.
The pickle process has been designed in such a way that this module is not required
to unpickle the traceback.


Usage. 1. 2. 3. 4.
=====

There are four things and only one function to know to get up and running.

### 1) Initialize

To be able to pickle tracebacks you first need to run the "init" function. This can happen anytime
before pickle. You can even have it trigger on startup if you wish.

``` python
import keepTrace
keepTrace.init()
```

### 2) Pickler

If you supply a pickler, it will use it to determine if an object can or cannot be pickled by that pickler.
In general, use the pickler you plan on later pickling the tracebacks with. ie: pickle, cloudpickle, dill.

If the pickler fails to pickle an object, the object will be replaced with a mock, stub, or representation.

If no pickler is used (default), then everything will go to the fallback. This means you can unpickle without the
original environment, but all objects will be replaced by mocks and stubs.

``` python
import keepTrace, pickle
keepTrace.init(pickler=pickle)
```

### 3) Depth

Depth controls how far beyond the traceback the pickle will reach. ie: objects within attributes, within classes within objects...etc...etc...

Objects at the edge of the pickle depth will be replaced by their representations.

Use a shallow depth (low number) to keep pickles lighter. Use a higher depth if you wish to record and inspect further and / or wish to have more truly functional objects (pickled objects with representations inside them will fail to work for obvious reasons).

Setting depth to 0 will provide only a representation of the traceback. Not overly useful and not debuggable.

Setting depth to -1 will make depth infinite.

``` python
import keepTrace
keepTrace.init(depth=5)
```

By default the pickles are very conservative. Everything will be mocked and stubbed. You will not need anything other than an
unpickler to view and inspect the traceback, but you will not be able to run any of the functionality either.

Setting depth to infinite, and using a heavy-duty pickler (dill) will lead to very detailed and interractive debugging.
You will however need to be able to provide the same environment as the original traceback.

### 4) Include Source

There is one final argument to init. This will attempt to take a snapshot of the source files at the
moment of serialization. This is active by default, and recommended that it stays that way.

However including the source in all your tracebacks can waste a lot of space if you have frequent logs. If you can access the files where you debug, and can be reasonably sure the source will not change, turning this off can make sense.

``` python
import keepTrace
keepTrace.init(include_source=False)
```

When saving a pickle, there are a couple of things you can do to dramatically shrink its size. gzip and pickletools.

``` python
import gzip, pickle, pickletools
with gzip.open(filepath, "wb") as f:
  data = pickle.dumps(traceback)
  data = pickletools.optimize(data)
  f.write(data)
```

Finally, an original message from pydump. The inspiration and initially the origin of this project. Still relevant.

> ### Possible uses
>
> This project (or approach) might be useful in multiprocessing environments
> running many unattended processes. The most common case for me is on
> production web servers that I can't really stop and debug. For each
> exception caught, I write a dump file and I can debug each issue on
> my own time, on my own box, even if I don't have the source, since
> the relevant source is stored in the dump file.
